        <h1>Re: Rowland University Credit Transfer</h1>
        <p>Dear Reverend Rowland,</p>
        <p>I'm writing to ask you about transfering credits for some of the classes I've taken at your University.</p>
        <h2>Dates</h2>
        <p>I started my first semester at Rowland University on <time datetime="2017-08-24">August 24th, 2017</time>. My first year at your University I took several classes. My new University is going to need this information in the near future. Could you please have it sent to them by:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><time datetime="2020-09-15">September 15th, 2020</time></li>
            <li><time datetime="2020-09-20">September 20th, 2020</time></li>
            <li><time datetime="2020-10-01">October 1st, 2020</time></li>
        </ul>
        <p>I'm going to need these as soon as possible because I'd like to make sure I gradutate on time.</p>
        <h2>Classes</h2>
        <p>If you are able to send that over by the dates listed above, I'm looking for credit for the following classes, in order of priority:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>WATR140: Turning H<sub>2</sub>O into wine, and the health benefits of Resveratrol (C<sub>14</sub>H<sub>12</sub>O<sub>3</sub>.)</li>
            <li>MUSC225: Measuring the effect on performance of funk bassplayers at temperatures exceeding 30°C (86°F), when the audience size exponentially increases (effect of 3 × 103 increasing to 3 × 104.)</li>
            <li>ISNT337: <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr> and <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> constructs for representing musical scores.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>These are only a few of the classes I've taken at your University. I <em>should</em> get credit for all the classes I took, but those three are the most important.</p>
    </body>

So please can you provide more information on each of these subjects, including how long you'd expect the research to take, required staff and other resources, and anything else you think we'd need to know? Thanks.

Animals of the Extended Perambulation
Yes, you are right! As part of my post-doctorate work, I did study animals. To answer your question, my favourite creatures are as follows, with definitions:

The Canadian Polar bear
A large predator, very hungry these days. Feeds almost entirely on seal.
The elk
An elk is a horned ungulate found primarily in the mountainous regions of British Columbia. It can be seen from railways, and also frequently visits the Banff centre for the arts.
The red-tailed hawk
An interesting example of historic misinformation: many people believe eagles make the screaming noise associated with them on film. This cry is instead the call of the red-tail.
For more of my research, see my research page (http://umd.edu).

Yours sincerely,
