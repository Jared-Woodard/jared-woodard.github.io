                About Holly
            </h2>
            <p>
                Holly is our family dog. She's a 6 year old, 8 lbs Havanese. She's mostly white but her ears are black and the coloration on her back is what is known as "blue" 
                amoung Havanese people. For a little tiny dog she's got a lot of energy but she also is a big sleeper. She loves going on walks in any weather except rain 
                and afterwards you can find her sleeping in her beds, on the couch, or on one of our beds. She's not a loud dog, but she'll bark ocassionally at other dogs or people. 
                If you get her riled up she might growl a little bit at you but it's harmless. When you pet her she might try and chew on your fingers a bit, but she never 
                bites too hard. She doesn't really like baths or car rides, but she's gotten much better with them over the years. We love her very much, please enjoy these photos of her!
